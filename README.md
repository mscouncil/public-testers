# MSC Î² Testers Group

This is the public repo for users to trial, discuss and feedback on the new tech platform for the Council.

# Instructions

If you are new to GitHub, the tl;dr is that is a very strong, new colloborative platform which empowers distibuted teams (mainly developers) to work better together asynchronously. 

In our case, we will just be using the "Issues" feature. To report a problem, click on the issues tab on the right and then "New Issue". Some important features to note are:

* GitHub uses [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to render all issues, documents, etc.
* When you start a new issue or reply to one, everybody in the group gets it in an email so you don't have to visit this website at all.
* You can reply to issues by email too.
* You can add images by just doing "ctrl+v" (e.g. take a screenshot, then just paste it in - GitHub will upload it for you and insert it)
* Try to be as descriptive as possible in reproducing a particular problem
* Besides reporting bugs, feel free to also start a open discussion on new features or ideas you think would be useful for the entire Council.
